## Lev App :calendar:

Lev App is a lightweight and cool web application that provides a list of upcoming holidays. The app is built using React.js and Pure CSS, with a touch of my creativity, resulting in a sleek and modern design that is easy to navigate.

The app's minimalistic user interface provides an effortless and seamless browsing experience, making it easy to find the holiday you're looking for quickly. The app is also fully responsive, so it works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.

The app's simplicity and lightweight make it ideal for users who want a fast and reliable way to view upcoming holidays. The app is hosted on Vercel, a cloud-based platform for deploying web applications, ensuring that the app is always available and fast.

Overall, the Holiday App is an excellent tool for anyone looking to plan their upcoming holidays or learn more about different holidays celebrated worldwide. Check out the hosted link at https://levapp.vercel.app/ and start exploring the upcoming holidays today! :tada:
